I'm a master's student in Electronic Systems Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), where I also earned my bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering. I am currently a member of the Interdisciplinary Data and Artificial Intelligence Lab (IDA Lab) and the Thermal Fluid Flow Group (T2F), funded by a CAPES/DS scholarship. My research focuses on machine learningâ€“based methods for thermomechanical analysis and performance prediction of heat exchangers and industrial valves.

In addition to my research activities, I lecture in undergraduate courses on Algorithms and Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Graph Theory. During my undergraduate studies, I served as a teaching assistant for Programming II (Algorithms and Data Structures) and participated in several research projects in collaboration with diverse research groups, including the Dynamic Systems Optimization and Simulation Cluster (NSO), the Naval Simulation Laboratory (LaSiN), and the Computer-Aided Manufacturing Research Group (GPCAM).

My academic interests include cyber-physical systems, computer vision, machine learning, and high-performance computing.
