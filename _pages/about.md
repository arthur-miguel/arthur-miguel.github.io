I'm a master's student in Electronic Systems Engineering at the <a href='https://ufsc.br'>Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC)</a>, where I also earned my bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering. I am currently a member of the <a href="https://idalab.ufsc.br/" target="_blank">Interdisciplinary Data and Artificial Intelligence Lab (IDA Lab)</a> and the <a href="https://t2f.ufsc.br/" target="_blank">Thermal Fluid Flow Group (T2F)</a>, funded by a CAPES scholarship. My research focuses on machine learningâ€“based methods for thermomechanical analysis and performance prediction of heat exchangers and industrial valves.

In addition to my research activities, I lecture in undergraduate courses on Algorithms and Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Graph Theory. During my undergraduate studies, I also served as a teaching assistant in the Algorithms and Data Structures course and participated in several research projects in collaboration with different research groups.
